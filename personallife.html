  <h2><em>Personal Life</em></h2>
  <h4>I believe that a good balance is essential to living life, in order to keep myself at peace and in a state of equilibrium,
    I like to do things such as:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Reading</li>
    <ul>
      <li>I primarily read non-fiction, with a bit of fiction for leisure/relaxation. Some of the genres that I read include:</li>
      <li>Stoic Philosophy, thoroughly enjoy reading the discourses of Marcus Aurelius, Seneca, and Epictetus.</li>
      <li>Psychology, books such as The Person and The Situation by Lee Ross and Richard Nisbett, and Consciousness Explained by Daniel C. Dennett.</li>
      <li>Self-Help, books such as Think & Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill, and Think Like A Winner by Dr. Walter Doyle Staples.</li>
      <li>Investment Philosophy, books such as Zero To One by Peter Thiel, and Against The Gods by Peter L. Bernstein.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Soccer</li>
    <ul>
      <li>I've played soccer since I was 8 years old, still do to this day. Soccer has allowed me to keep in healthy shape and compete in high ranking tournaments across Canada.</li>

    </ul>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Listening To Music</li>
    <ul>
      <li>I've been able to play the piano and guitar from a young age and knowing how to do so has allowed me to develop a strong passion towards good music, some of the music that I listen to includes:</li>
      <li>Piano music, such as the type composed by Ludivico Einaudi, Yann Tiersen, and Joep Beving.</li>
      <li>Jazz music, the type by Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and Bobby Darin.</li>

    </ul>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Spending time in Moldova</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Moldova (My Home Country) allows me to relax and be my whole self, some of the things I enjoy doing there include:</li>
      <li>Spending time with family; Growing up I have always placed key value on the importance of family and being in Moldova allows me to be beside everyone I hold close.</li>
      <li>Spending time in nature; Moldova has a humongous amount of untouched nature and this allows me to spend a lot of time going on walks, relaxing in nature, and exploring. </li>
      <li>Partaking in the culture; Moldova and it's inhabitants place a key value on culture and because of this I always have something to do, from Folk Culture, to Religious holidays, <br>
        there is always something bringing the people together.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
